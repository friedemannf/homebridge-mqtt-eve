# homebridge-mqtt-eve

A Homebridge plugin that emulates Eve devices and their history by connecting to an MQTT server and parsing incoming

capabilities. (Only visible in the Eve.app)

### Currently supported device types:

- Energy
- Climate
- Contact

See the Homebridge Config UI for configuration.
